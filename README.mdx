# mdx-test-data
Mdx file published as an npm package, for testing purposes.

## Why ?
I'm testing an approach where I manage some content as npm packages. 
This file is an example for some test suites.
 
<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'tomato' }}>
  <h3>This is JSX ...</h3>
  ... and should appear with a 20px padding and a tomato background color.
</div>
